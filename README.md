# hydra-core

Hydra Core documents the architecture and doctrine behind a risk-first, multi-engine automated system.

This repository is intentionally focused on:
- survivability over activity
- execution discipline over prediction
- constraint enforcement over discretion

Hydra is not a signal service.
Hydra is not built to trade every day.
Losses are expected — escalation is forbidden.

## What this repo contains
- doctrine: principles and non-negotiables
- architecture: high-level system design
- operations: operating rules and behavioural constraints

## What this repo does not contain
- strategy IP / entry logic
- deployable trading code
- broker credentials or configs

If a rule can be broken, it is not a rule.
