# Risk Doctrine

## North Star
Hydra exists to prevent catastrophic failure.

Hydra does not aim to maximise returns.
Hydra aims to make unsafe behaviour structurally impossible.

## Principles
1. Losses are allowed.
2. Damage is capped.
3. Escalation is forbidden.
4. Risk is enforced, not monitored.
5. If a rule can be broken, it is not a rule.
6. The system must survive boredom, volatility, and drawdown.

## Impossibilities
The following must be structurally impossible:
- trading without a predefined stop / invalid protective parameters
- increasing risk after a loss
- bypassing system disarm states
- continuing execution after a hard risk event
- exceeding predefined exposure limits

If any of the above occur, the system has failed.

## On “No Trade”
No trade is a valid output.

Hydra does not participate unless conditions align with its rules.
Inactivity is intentional, not accidental.

## Accountability
All actions must be logged.
All disarms must be explainable.
All inactivity must be defensible.
